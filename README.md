In this project we will deal with directed graphs and all kinds of algorithms that can be run on them.
In the project we will examine the runtimes of the algorithms and see visually how they work.

# Project departments
The project works so that when we run a graph from one of the json files the graph will be built in the program and then we can run the algorithms on it, add or remove nodes and edges from the graph or get information about nodes and edges in the graph.
The graph is divided into 2 main parts:

A. Graph construction.

B. The algorithms that can be run on the graph.

# Project idea
The idea of ​​the project is basically to create a directed graph as we wish and the possibility to look at the algorithms that can be run on directed graphs.

# So how does the project actually work?
The project is divided into 2 parts the first is the creation of the graph itself and the second is a visual presentation of the graph on a gui panel.

# Creating the graph
The graph is created and works according to the following slide:

The graph is created by edgs and nodes as you can see in the slide and you can add or subtract sides and vertices and run new graphs as you wish.

# DirectedWeightedGraphAlgorithm
The algorithm class is a class where certain algorithms can be run on the graph.
We will now explain each of the existing functions in the class:

*init* - 

*isConnected* -

*shortestPathDist*-

*shortestPath* -

*center* -

*dijkstra* - 

*tsp* -

*load* - 

*save* -
