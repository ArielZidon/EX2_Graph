In this project we will deal with directed graphs and all kinds of algorithms that can be run on them.
In the project we will examine the runtimes of the algorithms and see visually how they work.

# Project departments
The project works so that when we run a graph from one of the json files the graph will be built in the program and then we can run the algorithms on it, add or remove nodes and edges from the graph or get information about nodes and edges in the graph.
The graph is divided into 2 main parts:

A. Graph construction.

B. The algorithms that can be run on the graph.

@ The way the project is structured
